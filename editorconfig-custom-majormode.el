;;; Commentary:

;; An EditorConfig extension that defines a property to specify which
;; Emacs major-mode to use for files.

;; For example, add emacs_mode to your .editorconfig as follows, and
;; `nginx-mode' will be always enabled when visiting *.conf files.

;; [*.conf]
;; emacs_mode = nginx

;; Also this library has an experimental mmm-mode support.
;; To use it, add properties like:

;; [*.conf.j2]
;; emacs_mode = nginx
;; emacs_mmm_classes = jinja2

;; Multiple mmm_classes can be specified by separating classes with
;; commmas.

;; To enable this plugin, add `editorconfig-custom-majormode' to
;; `editorconfig-custom-hooks':

;; (add-hook 'editorconfig-custom-hooks
;;           'editorconfig-custom-majormode)
