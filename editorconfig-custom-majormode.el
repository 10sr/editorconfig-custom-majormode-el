;;; Commentary:

;; An EditorConfig extension that defines a property to specify which
;; Emacs major-mode to use for files.

;; For example, add emacs_mode to your .editorconfig as follows, and
;; `nginx-mode' will be always enabled when visiting *.conf files.

;; [*.conf]
;; emacs_mode = nginx

;; To enable this plugin, add `editorconfig-custom-majormode' to
;; `editorconfig-custom-hooks':

;; (add-hook 'editorconfig-custom-hooks
;;           'editorconfig-custom-majormode)

;;; Code:

(defun editorconfig-custom-majormode--is-a-mode-p (target want)
  "Return non-nil if major mode TARGET is a major mode WANT."
  (or (eq target
          want)
      (let ((parent (get target 'derived-mode-parent)))
        (and parent
             (editorconfig-custom-majormode--is-a-mode-p parent want)))))
